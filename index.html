    <p>Hey Everyone! My name is Easton Dan Bevan. I am from Eagle Idaho and this is my 2nd Semester here in rexburg at Brigham Young University Idaho. I am going into computer science, but i am not really sure where exactly it will take me yet!
    </p>
    <p>I am not married, have no kids, no grandkids either unfortunately. I absolutely love anything to do with adventure. I love Toyotas, Mountain bikes, and Snowboards. My biggest goal in life is to win the Intramural softball league here in rexburg. My favorite scripture is Alma 29:14-16... IFYKYK
